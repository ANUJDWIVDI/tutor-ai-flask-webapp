# ðŸ§  Project Title: Cognify - An AI Tutor for Personalized Learning ðŸ¤–
By: [@anuj_dwivedi](https://linktr.ee/anuj_dwivedi)

## Project Description ðŸš€
Cognify is an innovative educational application utilizing AI-powered algorithms to deliver customized riddles and puzzles to students based on their individual psychological profile. This web-based app utilizes a cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine to evaluate the student's responses and formulate the most suitable questions and challenges to enhance their cognitive abilities.

The app features a dynamic user interface that displays the user's progress through a series of levels, from 1 to 5, with corresponding scores ranging from 0 to 100. As the user progresses, they are provided with resources such as blog articles and interactive quizzes to help reinforce their learning and advance their level score. With an intuitive design, the app makes use of state-of-the-art technologies such as Flask, Python, HTML, and CSS to deliver a seamless user experience.

In addition to its robust educational features, Cognify also collects and analyzes user data to provide valuable insights into the learning process and inform future enhancements to the application. This unique approach to educational technology provides students with an engaging and personalized learning experience that can adapt to their individual strengths and challenges.
